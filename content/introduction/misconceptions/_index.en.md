Unfortunately, our general understanding of diabetes contains many incorrect concepts. I will try to clarify some misconceptions and what is right that we should know about diabetes.

|❌ Wrong|✅ Right|
|---	|---	|
|A person with type 1 diabetes can be treated through diet, which is diet, healthy eating, and lifestyle changes only.|Type 1 diabetics need insulin for life.|
|Diabetes is caused by eating too much sugar.|Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented or avoided, as it is an immune defect in the first place. As for the second type, sugary foods, soft drinks, and processed foods do not directly increase the risk of developing it, but all these things increase your risk of obesity. Obesity can lead to diabetes. But eating a lot of sugar is not a direct cause of diabetes, and this is for type two diabetes.|
|There are herbs that treat diabetes.|There are no magic herbs that cure diabetes.|
|Diabetics need special food.|Healthy and balanced food is the best solution. It is possible to include specific amounts of carbohydrates and sugars, and there is no deprivation for the patient of all foods and restricting him to eating a specific food.|
|Gestational diabetes is a temporary rise in glucose during pregnancy only and is not a cause of diabetes later on.|There are studies that say that gestational diabetes is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.|
|Can we prevent type 1 and type 2 diabetes?|Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent type 1 diabetes. As for the second type, it can be prevented by following a healthy diet and health system, reducing weight and changing lifestyle.|
|A diabetic patient does not need periodic follow-up if his sugar is regular.|Every diabetic patient needs routine periodic follow-up. This is to check blood pressure, nerves, eyes, and cumulative sugar measurement.|
|Diabetics do not need to measure blood pressure at home.|measuring blood sugar for a diabetic patient, the higher the sugar control rate, the better and the fewer complications.|
|Diabetes prevents a person from practicing his normal life.|Diabetes does not prevent a person from exercising his life because he can coexist with it, control it, and accompany diabetes.|
