The pancreas is responsible for insulin secretion in the body, helping to maintain the stability of glucose levels in the body. Specifically, beta cells in the pancreas are responsible for insulin secretion, making up 50% to 80% of the pancreas.

There are three main types of diabetes:

## Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes is the result of an immune defect where the body attacks and loses beta cells. As a result, the body cannot secrete insulin, or only secretes a very small amount. There is no specific cause for type 1 diabetes, and it can affect children or adults, but is traditionally known as juvenile diabetes because it affects mostly children. Insulin is a necessity for those with type 1 diabetes in order to maintain glucose levels.

## Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is due to anti-insulin resistance, lack of insulin secretion, or both. Obesity and advanced age are among the main causes of type 2 diabetes, and family history can impact the possibility of infection. Increasing physical activity and reducing carbohydrate intake can help reduce insulin resistance in cases of type 2 diabetes. Some medications that stimulate insulin secretion may also be prescribed, depending on the patient's condition and glucose analysis. Most cases, however, eventually require external insulin to be injected into the body. In some cases, patients can live with type 2 diabetes without external insulin by increasing physical activity and following a healthy diet.

## Gestational Diabetes

Gestational diabetes is similar to type 2 diabetes in terms of lack of insulin and weak response to the effect of insulin. However, it typically disappears or improves after giving birth, and requires careful medical monitoring during pregnancy to avoid complications for the mother or fetus.

In conclusion, diabetes is a chronic disease that a person must learn to live with, manage, and tame in order to live a normal life. While gestational diabetes is typically temporary if properly monitored, type 1 and type 2 diabetes are life-long conditions that require ongoing care and treatment.
