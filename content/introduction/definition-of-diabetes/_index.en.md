Our body needs energy for vital operations throughout the day. The means that provide the body with energy is eating and drinking. And this energy enters in different images, such as fats, protein, and carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates (or carbs, a common acronym in the world of diabetes) are the most important source of energy. Here comes the question: Why?. The answer is because the body converts carbohydrates into a type of sugar, which is glucose, and this is the main source of energy for the human brain.
In short, the brain needs energy in the form of glucose, and the body provides glucose by converting the carbohydrates we ate (or drank) into glucose.
Cells act like a locked door that needs a key to enter glucose, and the cells benefit from it in that they derive energy. This key is the hormone insulin.
Until here and everything is fine, so where is the problem?
The problem occurs if the body cannot secrete enough insulin for the cells to open and benefit from the glucose in the blood by absorbing it, or the body may secrete insulin in an appropriate amount, but the cells resist its absorption, and the result is a high level of glucose in the blood. This is known as diabetes mellitus.
