# T1D Life
Static website for blogging about T1D.

## Motive
I'm a T1D parent and a supporter for T1D groups for sharing experiences and communicating with other parents. Through out this support, I've found out that there are common questions, tips, tricks and practices that should be shared with the T1D community. I try through this idea to collect this information and organize an easy way to share this information with the community.

## Content
The content is created with blogging mindset. So it will be presented as posts/pages, then categorizing in collections.
The content is bilingual which is supporting Arabic and English.
